# Python Snippets

# Dependencies
requests.py contains dependencies needed to run all the examples in this directory.

# Running
To run, use the corresponding unit test module (e.g. foo_test.py for foo.py.) In some cases unit tests are within the same module, in those cases running ./foo.py should work.

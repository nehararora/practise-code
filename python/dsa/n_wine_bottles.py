n_wine_bottles.py:  An evil king has n bottles of wine, and a spy has just
poisoned one of them. Unfortunately, they do not know which one it is. The
poison is very deadly; just one drop diluted even a billion to one will still
kill. Even so, it takes a full month for the poison to take effect. Design a
scheme for determining exactly which one of the wine bottles was poisoned in
just one month's time while expending O(log n) taste testers.

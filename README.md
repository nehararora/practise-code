# Practise Code - Snippets of code for fun and profit!

A collection of large and small samples of code and problems to solve.

# Why?

As a practitioner of what is part science, part craft, part engineering, and at
times part voodoo, we tend to ignore one very important aspect of learning -
the element of repetition. Just as a craftsman or musician doesn't use unfamiliar
pieces to practice, as a software developer learning a new language I want to
have some familiar problems  (and a few unfamiliar ones as well) to work through.

This is my attempt at a library of solved problems that I can use as material for
learning new languages.

# Layout

For convenience the code is laid out by language. As far as possible, the code is
buildable (where applicable) and runnable.

Each individual directory contains it's own readme file with details on the specific
code layout.


# why Practise (instead of Practice)?
Not that it matters, but wanted to highlight the "verbiness" of the activity :)
